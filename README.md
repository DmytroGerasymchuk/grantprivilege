# Project Description

Utility to grant advanced LSA privileges using command-line interface instead of using manual GUIs like "gpedit.msc" and "secpol.msc".

# Where can it be used?

Mainly, for automation of installation and maintenance tasks and creation of unattended or semi-unattended jobs. And of course, for those of us who hate the overhead (both resources and mouse clicks) caused by the usage of GUI tools.

# What can be granted?

Everything that you can see for example in "gpedit.msc" under Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Local Policies / User Right Assignment!

# What are the pre-requisites?

Windows operating system and .NET (at least 2.0). That's all!

# How exactly it works?
